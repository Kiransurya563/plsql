->It was developed by Oracle
->PL/SQL, which stands for Procedural Language extensions to the 
  Structured Query Language (SQL).

3 Blocks:
Declarations: This section, starting with the keyword DECLARE, is optional and 
used for defining variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements required 
within the block.

Executable Commands: Enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END, this mandatory
section contains executable PL/SQL statements. It must include at least one executable 
line of code, even if it's just a NULL command indicating no action.

Exception Handling: This starts with the keyword EXCEPTION, this optional section deals 
with handling errors in the program through defined exceptions.

SQL V/S PL/SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for creating, manipulating,
and retrieving data from relational databases. SQL is mainly used to write queries, as 
well as create and execute DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements.
Whereas, PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is an extension of SQL. And it adds procedural 
capabilities to SQL, enabling the creation of more complex and powerful database applications. 
PL/SQL supports variables, data types, and control structures such as loops and conditionals, 
which SQL does not. This makes PL/SQL more efficient for writing program blocks, functions, 
procedures, triggers, and packages.
